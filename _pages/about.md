I’m a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, graduating in May 2027, with a focus in Networking and Cybersecurity. 

Over the past year and a half, I conducted research for the Hume Center for National Security and Technology, where I investigate secure applications of mobile distributed MIMO for military communications and future 5G/6G integration. I work with a team to find ways to integrate this new technology into our everyday lives. This role has given me experience in analyzing technical systems and understanding secure deployment strategies.


Beyond Academics
======
One of my favorite projects during that certification was using Jack the Ripper on our Ubuntu VMs to crack as many passwords as possible out of 1000. I enjoyed just finding different modes and masks to use to try and crack more passwords because, while it was tedious work, it was rewarding and fun.

Leadership
======
On the leadership side, I serve as a Residential Assistant and Peer Mentor for CEED at Virginia Tech. These roles have taught me how to guide teams, foster community, and support others’ academic and personal growth — skills that translate directly into collaborating in professional environments.
